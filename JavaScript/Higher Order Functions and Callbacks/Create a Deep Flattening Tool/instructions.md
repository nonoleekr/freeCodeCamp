# Create a Deep Flattening Tool

In this lab, you will be implementing an array flattening algorithm.

Flattening an array means turning a nested array of any depth into a single, one-dimensional array. The process extracts all elements in order, unwrapping only arrays. Other types are left unchanged.

## Examples

| Original                | Flattened              |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `[[1], [], [2, [3]]]`   | `[1, 2, 3]`            |
| `[1, {"foo": "bar"}, [2]]` | `[1, {"foo": "bar"}, 2]` |
| `["baz", [1, 2], {}]`   | `["baz", 1, 2, {}]`    |

## Objective

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

## User Stories

- You should have a function named `steamrollArray`.
- The `steamrollArray` function should accept one argument: a nested array.
- The function should flatten the nested array, accounting for varying levels of nesting.
- Your solution should **not** use the `Array.prototype.flat()` or `Array.prototype.flatMap()` methods.
- Global variables should not be used.
